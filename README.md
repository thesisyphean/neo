# NeoCOOP

## ⚠️ Warning ⚠️

This project is extremely WIP! There are some serious rough patches in many parts of the code. These patches will be smoothed over and this warning will (hopefully) be removed in November / December holidays. Documentation will follow soon after the primary fixes.

## About

This is a rust port of an agent-based model by [Brandon Gower-Winter](https://github.com/BrandonGower-Winter). [The original model](https://github.com/BrandonGower-Winter/NeoCOOP) is described as "An Agent-Based Model simulating the emergence and evolution of altruistic and selfish behaviour in Neolithic Households under varying degrees of environmental stress."

## Visualisation

A visualisation of a simulation is available in the root of the project, called `visual.gif`.
